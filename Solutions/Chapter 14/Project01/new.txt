C is quirky,  flawed,  and  an  enormous  success.  Although
accidents of history surely helped, it evidently satisfied a
need for a system implementation language eficient enough to
displace  assembly  language, yet sufficinently abstract and
fluent to describe algorithms and  interactions  in  a  wide
variety    of    enviroments.    --    Dennis   M.   Ritchie
